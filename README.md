TIC3001: Demo project for using Travis and Maven.

This project was developed with **Java 8**. Make sure you have appropriate [SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed on your machine.

## Install Maven
Maven is a build manager for Java projects. It helps you to install Java libraries, automate the project build process and manage your Java project.

Install Maven on:
* Mac: as simple as `$ brew install maven` (in case you don't know what is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you should use it now).
* Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt-get install maven`
* Windows: refer to this [guide](https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)
